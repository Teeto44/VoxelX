I do not own, nor have I contributed, modified, or In anyway created something 
new with this library. This is a statically built combination of three libraries
(rLImgui, cimgui, and imgui). All credit goes to its creators and all three of 
their licenses have been included in the "license(s)" folder. I have the github
repositories below if you would like to see them for yourself or support the
creators.
